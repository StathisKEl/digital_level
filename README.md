# digital_level
A digital spirit level based on the Arduino Uno Rev3 development board.

Once the LCD indication of the spirit level that has been previously placed on the reference plane is x_axis:0 and y_axis:0 the digital spirit level is ready for use.
This means that with the help of this device any object with a flat surface can be placed in any angle ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees on the reference plane. In order to achieve the desire placement of the object on the reference plane the digital spirit level must be placed on the flat surface of the object and the user must constantly checking the LCD indication while moving the digital spirit level for setting the right angle between the object and the reference plane in both x and y axis.
